# Analysis-of-Email Worm File
Part 1 of project evaluating emails with (sourcecode). The first is an email sourcecode HTML file of a worm Bubbleboy. Source code from user: Da2dalus/The-MALWARE-Repo.
The second is an email viewed from the orginal message that is phishing (grifting for a bitcoin donation) "supposedly" from Elon Musk. 
Mitigation from received spam/phishing is to block emails that contain .xhtml and .htm or .hmtl attachments as these file types are rarely sent.
